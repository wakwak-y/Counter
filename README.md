# Counter App - Swift Composable Architecture (TCA) Tutorial

This project is a simple counter application developed as part of the **Swift Composable Architecture (TCA)** tutorial from Point-Free.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to learn and understand the core concepts of TCA by following the official tutorial available here:
[Point-Free TCA Tutorial - Your First Feature](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/tutorials/composablearchitecture/01-01-yourfirstfeature/)

This repository is not intended to serve as a standalone application but rather as an educational resource demonstrating the basics of TCA.
